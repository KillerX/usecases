# Use Cases

In this repository we would like to collect use cases where browsers communicate with web-server-capable
via HTTP and/or WebSocket over TLS, for the purpose of clarifying network and security requirements.

If you find another use case, please submit a Pull Request to add it to [UseCases.md](UseCases.md), or add your comment
to relevant GitHub issues.
